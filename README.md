  Care Brokers
</h1>

A 'care broker' is a company, organization, or individual acting as an intermediary between care workers and their clients. This site collects the anonymized words and experiences of care workers who navigate care brokers in their day-to-day lives. We hope to show the similarities and differences in how care brokers structure and control caregivers and their workplaces.

TO DO:
* Add anonymized participant quotes.
* Add researcher commentary.
* Add some way to show relationships and links between quotes and themes.
* Add details of how our study was conducted, bios of the authors, and words of thanks and appreciation to our study's participants.
