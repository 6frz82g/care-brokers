      “I guess, one thing that is frustrating about care.com is like, if you don't respond to messages, you, it's like, you calculate the percentage of messages that you respond to within 24 hours. So like, you kind of have to respond to everything. Um, or else your percentage lowers, and like, the lower your percentage, the less likely you are to show up in a search result... it's like, obviously not the case with parents that they have to respond. So it's, that makes it like a little, like, high pressure. Because I mean, I honestly, there's a lot of, like, messages I've gotten where, like, I would just prefer not to respond like, you know, four kids for $8 an hour. Like, you know, I'd rather just not respond to that
    </li>
    <li>
      "I just kind of prefer to be off the platform, like, just because of the whole, like, monitoring the messaging responses and stuff"
    </li>

      [sitter city] "I've had potential families, like email me or use their messaging app repeatedly and wouldn't take no for an answer and they have an option to schedule you an interview. So I kept getting this pop up that says you have an interview scheduled on this day at this time with this person. And it was the same person every time and I kept messaging him Look, I cannot go drive the next state over to go work for your family and live there and he hadn't in the price he wanted to pay was like illegal price is not even minimum wage"
    </li>

      "so I live in the south. So people hide their family drama really well, and they all have,like, this uppity kind of demeanor. And you just think it's a nice, regular family until you find out later. So I'd say the interviews aren't, it's more for the family to decide if you're a good fit, rather than for you to decide if the family’s a good fit, because they do not reveal anything about themselves."

      "signing up was pretty straightforward. Once you get into it, it's harder to find jobs, it's a little harder to use. Sometimes, there's a lot of spam on there now. So you see, like a really, really good offer. And it wouldn't be, like —  it would be too good to be true. And so when you first start, and you first sign up, like you have to kind of learn your way, through everything, because it gets a little confusing. And then there, like I said, there's all this spam that you have to sort through. But like the signing up process is easy. [laughs]"

      "I had to be really rigorous about trying to reach out to people, and being like, “Hey, this is me.” And I would try to plug in like, “I'm a student!” so that they would, so that they would take me on. And I would also have to, like, again, it had to be a lot of trust that didn't, because I didn't have like, I guess formal references. Like I had the, the women that I knew that were mostly Spanish speaking. But I didn't have like that super formal reference. And so I really had to just be like, word of, like, letting them know, I have this many years of experience... Um, I didn't— on my actual profile, I didn't put that I had years of experience, because at the time, I thought, like, you know, formally, again, I don't have, I don't have that recognition."

      "one thing is like, disciplinary style, like, I feel like, it doesn't have to match but I definitely, I don't know, I, I feel like I'm kind of in the middle. Like, there's some parents where, in the interview, they'll say to me, like, “we try not to say the word no, to the kids.” And I'll be like, I don't think I can do that. Like, you know, like, I, I respect it, like, I get where they're coming from in a way, but like, and I have some who like, feel like in the interview, like, start, like yelling at their kids in front of me. And just like, you know, I just kind of get the sense that, like, I don't know, the kids aren't really allowed to be kids"
    </li>
    <li>
      "I kind of just look for like, sort of compatible styles. You know, how, like, autonomous, I'll be able to be like, I don't want to be like, micromanaged too much. I had one family that was like, you know, we expect her nanny to text us every 30 minutes with an update. And I was like, I can't do that...it got to the point where I was there for two months. And it was just like, nothing relented, you know, they've just still wanted the same, like, just constant updates, like constant like, like documentation of like, what we were doing and stuff... I just I feel like there's just not that much trust, I guess. And it also made my job a lot harder."
    </li>
    <li>
      "Sometimes I work up the nerve to ask if they have cameras. Um, it depends on like, how many offers I'm getting lately, because I feel like some parents don't like if you ask about that. Like, if I'm more like, desperate to get a job. I just won't bring it up. But that is something that I'm trying to ask about more just to like, have respect for myself, I guess"
    </li>
    <li>
      "But just I noticed that like, no one ever said in the interview process, like, “oh, by the way, we have cameras. Is that alright with you?” And yeah, I just feel like, when I feel like I'm being watched, I don't do my job as well, because I kind of get inside my head. Like, I feel like part of being a nanny is like you have to, like be able to be actually silly with kids and stuff. Like, in a way that like, you know, I don't know that I would want to act like that, like do like funny voices and stuff like around an adult. So it's like, I get in my head. And then yeah, I just like wonder, you know, who has access to the footage and like, where they're storing it? And, um, yeah, it also just feels I guess a little bit disrespectful to have someone being filmed and not let them know."

      "I think the contract is if I'm going to be like a nanny for their household, like a regular set schedule type thing, versus if I'm just going to babysit on date nights and weekends"
    </li>
    <li>
      "it's a little kind of awkward at first, just because, you know, when you're babysitting people, you know, it's the I feel like it's a little more lenience versus [when] you're going into someone's house on like, if you find them on a care, some sort of care app, it's someone you don't--probably don't know, and you're going into their house. And there's a different set of, you know, rules, maybe culture that they have, so that you, there's a lot of other things that you kind of have to take into account that you, I mean, I didn't really have to do you know, babysitting my siblings, I kind of knew what should and shouldn't happen based on how, you know, [how] my parents parented them. But working on, you know, a caregiving app, you kind of go into an environment not knowing, you know, really what to expect until you kind of get there and get a feel for it"
    </li>
    <li>
      "I learned eventually that when I was talking to parents, I had to be clear about that, so that they wouldn't place more on me. Because, for instance, I had another family and that expected me to bring their child home, I mean, to go pick up their child to help them with their homework, and then clean the entire house. And I'm like, my job is not to clean the fucking house. And so I had to navigate communicating with different clients about like, that's not appropriate, or this is what I consider my role to be, if you need it to be a different role, then I'm going to have to charge you a little more...I remember one time this lady was like, but you drive to work. And I'm like, She's like, when you drive to work. So why should I compensate you for gas? And I'm like, I'm picking up your fucking child. That's why like, that's part of the job. You know, it's not, yeah, I had to really put my foot down with some of these women, because I'm just like, you know, it's interesting. I know, you care for your child, but you don't realize how much labor goes goes into taking like raising your fucking kid and doing doing it safely. So yeah, figuring also recognizing that right, like, I think people don't they value care work, but I don't think it's always in monetary ways. And also in, in recognizing labor unless it's a lot of labor."
