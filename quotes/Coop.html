      "And so when, when we recruit people, or when people come into contact with “Co Op”, I believe that the image that they see is, is an alternative to the mainstream, dominant culture. And I think what happens a lot of the time, is that there's not an acknowledgement that the dominant culture is in everyone, whether they're in a co op, or whether they're in a traditional top down hierarchy. Because, Because it's internalized capitalism,"

      "we have a profile setup, where we fill in boxes, all sorts of details about ourselves. And if you're happy with it, there's also a little picture of yourself on there as well. And you're matched up to people. So people that are wanting to receive support are allowed to go on there, have a look through, see if there's a certain person's personality that they, you know, they, they think they would get on with, or they've got the same interests or skills in life"

      "it kind of works both ways. So like so when I first started, I obviously have like my, my usual people in the week now I have a Thursday with a certain lady, I have a Wednesday with a certain guy, and I've kind of got a good rota and I will fill in, you know as and when I can, but when it came to me starting out at equal care, and I was only just setting up, I would, you know, be chosen by somebody, say, you know, and I'd be put forward and it would be “Hi, cat,” and “this lady would like to meet you.” And, and that's my option then. And you know, I've got a little bit of background on them, what they require, what they're looking for, and how they are. And then that's my choice, then I can go and meet the person I can say actually I don’t think this is a good match, or it's not for me."

      "But the platform is going to take, is going to slowly take over every aspect of what we do, and one of them is matching. So the way it's gonna work in the future, is that we've all got a profile, and that's people receiving support and people giving support, we've all got a profile, and it's going to be kind of a bit like a dating site. So it's going to be that people can check out your profile. And, you know, they can see what your skills are, and what's important to you, and all that kind of thing. And they can maybe register an interest, and then I can look at them. But you'd like I can see what what a care visit might look like, what things they need help with, and decide whether that's, you know, speaks to my skills, and decide, you know, see what's important to them, and whether we're going to be compatible. So that's, that's the way that's going to work for the future, but there’s still going to then be an introduction."

      "However, up until now, the way it's worked has been more that I think the facilitators have, they will give you options. But they'll also have a pretty good idea, because there's not many people, they have a pretty good idea of who might appeal to who. So I guess the way it's worked so far as I've been approached, and just set up, we've got this person, and they tend to want to help with this. And that and we know that that’s, you know, in line with your skills, and she's really interesting. We think, you know, they've looked at your profile, and they're open to meeting you, sort of thing. So then we’re— we have a supported conversation where myself and a facilitator will go around and visit. And we'll generally just start off by sitting together and just having having a chat really. And just seeing if there's any chemistry. That's, that tends to be how it works. It's been a little bit unstructured up until now."

      "So when I first had a supportive conversation, I, I'd never, I'd never been matched to the client in my life before, I just been sent places. So I met I met these two people and was just really nice. Yeah, definitely, I'd really like to work with them. You know, they wanted to work with me. And then after I started, I realized there was a bunch of things that maybe I should have asked. So now, I've got lots of things written down...And then afterwards, there's a cooling off period. And both of you are free to say yes or no. So there might be any, any number of reasons why I might say yes or no. It means that I'm not working with anybody that I haven't…  both of us haven't agreed that we want to see more of each other."

      "it makes you feel a bit more important and a bit more like you've got a voice, whereas, you know, in the traditional agency I was with before, and I was going to quite a few calls where I was being abused, and I was being hit and my hair pulled and, you know, I was reporting all this, and it was a case of “there's nobody else”. So you go in. And many a time I've been in not very nice situations where I've come away, upset or dreading going the day after, and like almost like a safeguarding issue, and that would never happen here. Because I know I've got the voice and, and I'll be listened to and yeah, it's it's so different. It's unbelievable."

      "[Mediation of carer-client conflict] Um, it was actually, the, it was the two founders that— so it wasn't like professional mediators, it was, um, guess they're facilitators. So actually, the fact that they’re founders are neither here nor there in this situation. When there's a problem, sometimes, we might not need them, we might sort it out ourselves. But in this instance, everybody felt like they could do with a bit of input. So a couple of their facilitators kind of helped us to structure conversations, where we said what the problems were, and had an opportunity to say why we felt we'd reacted in the way that we had, and also had an opportunity to say what we actually wanted. And it was really constructive. I think initially, the two of us were, were not able to, to get through it. And if we had been able to, we wouldn't have needed the support, because we did need the support it was offered. And it seems to me that that's something that's like built in to the model."

      " Like, I'll give you an example. Money, for example. So what to do about money. So what if somebody wants to give you some money to get the shop and buy them something? So, like…  That's something, especially when you’re alone working with somebody, that can be a really thorny thing, because like, I don't know, like, if that's done entirely on trust, then what happens if they then turn around and say, Oh, you only gave me two pound change. And like, I supposed to have a fiver. And there's no one around, no witness, and you didn't keep the receipt, you haven't written it down anywhere. And you've not taken a [unintelligible] like. However, if you don't tell if you don't have the conversation with them about what's a safe procedure for dealing with money, and you start writing things down and taking pictures of receipts, they might start thinking, “What, don't you trust me?” Like, it's, it can be an insult. So on the one hand, you don't want to insult them, when on the other hand, you don't want to make yourself vulnerable."
